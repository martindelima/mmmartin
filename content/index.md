Hi, I’m Martin. This is my little internet burrow.

I like rain, warm-tinted light, and dark, enclosed spaces.

I'm a designer. Trying, anyway. I've claimed it to be my trade for so long, but not having had a sincere go, I'm doing it now. Wish me luck.

My *career* is being a husband and father (I guess that’s two things already). Just trying my best each day.

My personal ethos is to be chillin’. Lord knows we need it.

## Currently:
Building my portfolio from scratch. Starting with branding for a local playgroup my wife started, then building a lil’ website for it as well.
