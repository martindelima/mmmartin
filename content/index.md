Hi, I’m Martin. This is my little internet burrow.

I like rain, warm-tinted light, and dark, enclosed spaces.

I'm a designer. Trying, anyway. I've claimed it to be my trade for so long, but not having had a sincere go, I'm doing it now. Wish me luck.

My *career* is being a husband and father (I guess that’s two things already). Just trying my best each day.

My personal ethos is to be chillin’. Lord knows we need it.

## Currently:
New role’s taking a lot out of me. Plus a recurring foot injury just eroding my trust in my body.

It’ll buff out.
