<div class="text">

Hi, I’m Martin. This is my little internet burrow.

I like rain, warm-tinted light, and dark, enclosed spaces.

I used to be a frontend developer by trade. I don’t quite know where I'm going yet, but I'm relieved to have gone.

My *career* is being a husband and father (I guess that’s two things already). Just trying my best each day.

My personal ethos is to be chillin’. Lord knows we need it.
