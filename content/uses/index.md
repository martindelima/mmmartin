<h1>My desk</h1>

<div class="text">

I love reading about the tools people use, but I also try not to fetishise gear. It’s a tough balance! I think I’ve found it though, at least in this moment. Over time, I’ve learned what works for me. I’ve designed my setup to be light, portable, and joyful.

For context: I use these to write, design, make lil’ websites, edit photos, and draw. The things below make it all fun to do.

## The desk
- [Desky standing desk](https://desky.com.au/products/dual-small-standing-desk?variant=42254019494044), 100cm
	- They’re the only local company making standing desks at this size, and it’s rock solid. I work standing most of the time; it helps diffuse any energy that I’ve learned gets pent up when sitting down.

### Desk lovelies
- Ikea Ranarp work lamp
	- There’s just something about a nice lamp late at night that gives me a mellow, buzzing energy. A tad large, but I find it pleasing enough to warrant the space.
- Lego flower bouquet
	- The loveliest use of Lego there could ever be. I can’t imagine them topping this.
- A drawing my daughter made
	- Best thing in here. She even switches it up now and then, like some sort of subscription! I’m grateful for it, every time. Maybe me and my wife should add something of ours, too.

I may not always be at this desk, but when I am, I’m in the zone. I *want* to work here more than anyplace else.

## Hardware
- M2 Macbook Air, *Jupiter*
	- Almost perfectly invisible. My one gripe is if I wake it from sleep too quickly, it sometimes triggers a kernel panic. The wallpaper is a frame from [*The Red Turtle*,](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3666024). Lovely film.
- iPad Mini (2024), *Saturn*
	- For reading, games, editing photos, and drawing. Sometimes a second screen. The most sincere form of the iPad.
- iPhone 15 Pro, *Mercury*
	- My camera, chosen specifically because it’s the last one with the 3× tele lens. I get far more mileage out of ~80mm than ~120mm. It’s a phone too, I guess.

What a time we’re living in. This is *so much computer* within my grasp. For what I do with them, I don’t think I need any more, honestly. Until we can directly translate thought into digital output, I’m good.

### Accessories
- [Nexstand K2](http://www.nexstand.com)
	- I find I don’t make use of monitors too well; I can’t stand the eye travel. I need the one thing I’m doing to be fully visually graspable. Virtual desktops serve me better than screen real estate.
- [Nuphy Air60 v2](https://nuphy.com/products/air60-v2?variant=40715869225069)
	- A 60% layout keyboard with arrow keys has long been an unreasonable dream of mine, and Nuphy made it real. I got it with Brown switches, but am curious about the Wisterias. I never thought I’d be switch-curious, but typefeel and sonic texture are a big deal if you’re on a keyboard this much. I also got the [Twilight keycaps](https://nuphy.com/collections/keycaps/products/coast-twilight-nsa?variant=40931790585965), which I feel should have been the default for this colour.
- Logitech MX Anywhere 3
	- A delight. Flicking the mouse wheel to free-fall scroll still makes me go *whoosh* every time, and stopping the wheel with your finger has a satisfying inertia. It’s practically a fidget toy. More hardware should be like this.

These peripherals feel like the stars aligning; like a latch inside me *ker-chunked* into place. The tactility they add to these everyday actions is cool and reassuring. Now, on to what the hardware enables.

## Software
### Tools for making
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
	- When I realised I could just turn off and hide a lot of stuff, I switched. All my text output is here; from notes to longform writing. Also a to-do file for when I can’t do something right away. I find that’s about the absolute extent of “task management” that works for me. Any more and I procrastinate.
- [Figma](http://figma.com)
	- I’ve avoided Adobe so hard throughout my life. One reason I learned front-end dev was to skip Photoshop. I’m glad the buyout didn’t happen. But anyways, yeah, Figma! Figma is good.
- [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com)
	- It’s an open-source version of VS Code. I switched mainly to get rid of the AI stuff. Ever reliable.
- [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
	- I’m the type of person who really needs to have a UI for git. Lets my brain wrap around it better.
- [Photomator](https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/)
	- My main photo editor. It works right off the camera roll, and has every editing feature I need…which isn’t a lot, to be fair. I rather hate editing. I enjoy taking photos far more than tweaking them.
- [Procreate](https://procreate.com/procreate) and [Procreate Dreams](https://procreate.com/dreams)
	- The de facto iPad drawing app. They deserve all the success they have. I can’t think of a way I disagree with how these apps work.

The best thing about each of these is they disappear when I’m using them. It’s a dance: you learn the thing, and it gives you enough space to do what you want to do with it.

### Inputs
Inputs! Your outputs come from them, and so they are also tools.

- Safari
	- My main browser; the others I just test with. Reading list and iCloud tabs get heavy use. I don’t really need much else.
- [Reeder Classic](https://www.reeder.app/classic/)
	- RSS forever, baby. No social media for me. It’s blogs, webcomics, and [newsletters](https://kill-the-newsletter.com) all the way down.
- [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com)
	- Me and Instapaper go way back since its release, which is…17 *years,* as of this writing! Damn. Nearly everything I read on the web gets funnelled into Instapaper. [Must be why I love Lyon so much](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/1577/instapaper-ios-app).
- Apple Books
	- So much of my reading has been online, and so my digital library is pretty sparse. Recently I’ve found I read more when it’s a physical book, plus actually going to the library is nice. I’ve also been experimenting with reading more PDFs over epubs—it helps retain more of the book’s design.

I also keep an inspo library, which is just a folder on my iCloud I browse on. Any image I resonate with gets plucked like a wildflower and stashed within. I wish Finder had some sort of masonry view. That’s about all I’m yearning for software-wise I think.

### Utilities
- [Soulver](https://soulver.app)
	- Being able to write text *while* thinking about numbers was a paradigm shift for me. Indispensable.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)
	- I have three main uses for it: opening apps & files, toggling dark mode/night shift, and clipboard history. With MacOS 26 adding these features to Spotlight, we might part ways soon.
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai)
	- Lets you add custom keyboard shortcuts or mouse/trackpad gestures to apps. Mostly so that <kbd>ctrl+tab</kbd> on browsers actually works for me. Does window management too! I need it for my computer to feel like home.

So yeah! That’s mostly it. Writing all this, I realise that I am very happy with my setup right now. I’ve stayed up nights just from the *pleasure* of being at my desk. I reached that state by paring down and letting how I feel dictate the space, over any fleeting wants. The getting stuff is to enjoy making stuff. I’m happy. This is plenty.
