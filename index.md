<div class="text">

Hey, I’m Martin. This is my little internet burrow.

I’m a husband and a father. That‘s my career. I’m trying my best to be good at it.

I’m a web designer/developer by trade. I don’t believe you could truly separate the two, so I make do with the slash.

My personal ethos is to be *chillin’*.
