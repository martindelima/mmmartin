<div class="text">

Hi, I’m Martin. This is my little internet burrow.

I like rain, warm-tinted light, and dark, enclosed spaces.

I’m a web designer/developer by trade. I don’t believe you could truly separate the two, so I make do with the slash.

My *career* is being a husband and father (I guess that’s two things already). Just trying my best each day.

My personal ethos is to be chillin’. Lord knows we need it.
